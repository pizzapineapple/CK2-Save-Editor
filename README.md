# CK2-Save-Editor
A small save editor I made for Crusader Kings 2.

I made this with the intention of reducing the amount of time required to edit a Crusader Kings 2 Save file. Hopefully, this will reduce the number of lines you will have to scroll through to modify your campaign. 

I do not own the images used in this. The intent was to mirror the CK2 UI experience not copyright infringement.
